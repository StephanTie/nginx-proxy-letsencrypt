# docker-compose for nginx-proxy-letsencrypt
Install script and Docker compose yml file for creating nginx proxy (from jwilder) with letsencrypt (from jrcs) to have a proxy service with ssl for php webapps generated by scriptcase (see my scriptcase repository https://github.com/StephanTie/scriptcase_prod.git)

Prerequisites Starting point: Ensure versions are equal or higher for: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS or higher with ufw,git,ssh installed  docker version 18.09.7 docker-compose 1.29.2

**Step 1 - Precautions for automatic iptable changes by docker. **

When using docker first of all you do not want starting containers automatically opening ports and change the iptables. Also added standard dns.

edit daemon.json: sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

{ "iptables" : false }

{ "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.8.4"] }

restart docker: sudo systemctl start docker

**** Step 2 - Starting nginx-proxy-letsencrypt container with docker-compose ** 
** This step creates docker network ${NETWORK) which is defined in .env ****

cd /data (or any other place you want to keep your docker entities)

git clone https://github.com/StephanTie/nginx-proxy-letsencrypt.git

cd nginx-proxy-letsencrypt

sudo ./firststeponly.sh

**** step 3 check **

sudo docker-compose logs
